1. **See if we can talk to the iPad (using [peertalk](https://github.com/rsms/peertalk/)) from Rust**
2. Grab the X11 screen buffer from Rust and transfer it over the Peertalk socket
3. Hack up the Peer example iOS app to display the X11 screen buffer as it comes in
4. Optimization? Maybe video encoding and using UDP instead of TCP
